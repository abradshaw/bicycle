# bicycle, version 0.1
This is a simple Ansible based service to provide operations capabilities such as provisioning, life cycle management and troubleshooting for Red Hat Enterprise Linux. For people who do not need a satellite, but who needs a bicycle. Ment to be used with Ansible Tower, Red Hat Insights and Red Hat Network subscription service, but can be used standalone.

# Installing Bicycle
The Bicycle is where you keep yum repositories and kickstart files. If you do not need a GUI or the ability to centrally see which server needs what updates a.s.o. - then you only need to install this.

## Installing the Bicycle server on Amazon EC2
Run below playbook to provision a server automatically on Amazon EC2. By default a t2.large instance is used.
```
git clone https://github.com/mglantz/bicycle 
cd bicycle/provisioning
vi provisioning.yml
ansible-playbook -i ./provisioning-inventory ./provisioning.yml --private-key=/path/to/private_key.pem -u root
```

## Manual installation of the Bicycle server
* Install Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7-latest on a server with appropriate specs (2 CPU cores, 8 GB of memory is OK for ~200 servers).
* Install and configure required software
```
# yum install httpd httpd-tools createrepo yum-utils
# mkdir /var/www/html
# chmod 755 /var/www/html
# systemctl enable httpd
# systemctl start httpd
# git clone http://github.com/mglantz/bicycle
```
* Open firewalls to Bicycle on port 80 and from Bicycle on port 22 if you want to use it as an Ansible bastion host.

## Getting advanced capabilities (GUI & Errata management)
* If you want a supported GUI for Bicycle, install Ansible Tower (https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/quickinstall/index.html) or AWX (https://github.com/ansible/awx).

* If you want advanced errata management where you can see which server is missing what update and much more, get Red Hat Insight ( https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-insights#getstarted ). 

# Managing Bicycle from the GUI
This is if you are running Ansible Tower or AWX. Just import the playbooks into an Ansible Tower or AWX project and create job templates for the playbooks. Automation and instructions for this will come later. For now, look for details in the command line section below.

## Managing subscriptions, errata and predictive troubleshooting
Red Hat Insight will provide you with information about what server needs to be updated and also generate Ansible playbooks to apply required errata. Integrate Ansible Tower or AWX with Red Hat Insights: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/insights.html. To run Red Hat Insight you also need to register your servers to Red Hat Network. Do this with the commands below. Please note that we disable any yum repos enabled via Red Hat Network, as we like that to go via Bicycle:
```
subscription-manager register
subscription-manager repos --disable=*
```

## Run arbitrary remote commands on servers
Use Ansible: http://www.ansible.com and https://www.ansible.com/products/tower or https://github.com/ansible/awx

# Managing Bicycle from a command line
Before starting to operate your Bicycle, update manage/bicycle-inventory with the correct IP address to your Bicycle.

## Synchronize a yum repository to your Bicycle
Below playbook will synchronize a yum repository from the network/internet to /var/www/html/repo-id. The repository will become available via http://bicycle/repo-id.
```
cd bicycle/manage
ansible-playbook -i ./bicycle-inventory reposync.yml --private-key=/path/to/private.pem -u root \
--extra-vars "repo=repository-id"
```

## Clone yum repository
To copy an an already synced yum repository or to synchronize any two yum repositories from A to B, use this playbook.
```
cd bicycle/manage
ansible-playbook -i ./bicycle-inventory repoclone.yml --private-key=/path/to/private.pem -u root \
--extra-vars "from_repo=repository-id to_repo=repository-id"
```

## Create or update a kickstart
To create or update a kickstart file, use this playbook. Created kickstart files will be made available via http://bicycle/kickstart-name. For help on creating a kickstart file, please visit https://access.redhat.com/labs/kickstartconfig/
```
cd bicycle/manage
cp templates/kickstart-example.j2 templates/my-kickstart.j2
vi templates/my-kickstart.j2
ansible-playbook -i ./bicycle-inventory kickstart.yml --private-key=/path/to/private.pem -u root \
--extra-vars "ks-name=filename ks-template=filename.j2"
```

## Run arbitrary remote commands on servers
Use Ansible: http://www.ansible.com, https://www.ansible.com/products/tower or https://github.com/ansible/awx

# Subscription management
You get subscription management via Red Hat Network. When registering your system, don't forget to disable any repositories enabled on Red Hat Network afterwards. Eg:
```
subscription-manager register
subscription-manager repos --disable=*
```
